Building VLMC

Dependencies
============

- Latest version of VLC installed (from the git repository)
- Qt framework >= 4.5.0

Get the sources
===============

	git clone git://git.videolan.org/vlmc.git

Building VLMC
=============

A typical way to build VLMC is:

	cmake .
	make

Running VLMC
============

	./vlmc

Building and Packaging on Mac OS
================================

Download and unzip (libVLC) contribs for Mac OSX (i386), in /contribs:
#FIXME: Arrange for hosting on videolan.org
  http://rohityadav.in/projects/videolan/vlmc/contribs/

On Mac OS:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

This will by default create a Mac Bundle, vlmc.app
To create a dmg image:
 Uncomment #dmg in /src/CMakeLists.txt, at the end of the file.
 and follow the build process, the dmg will be created in /build/bin

Packaging
=========

On Linux, an easy way to make package is:
   cmake .
   make package

But this by default will search for available pkg builders and build accordingly.
To force building deb:
   cpack -G DEB
To force building rpm:
   cpack -G RPM
   
Installing
==========

If you have the deb/rpm pkg, install it!
To remove:
apt-get remove vlmc
rpm remove vlmc

Issues
======

If you run into problems, you can ask for help on <vlmc-devel@videolan.org> and
IRC channel #vlmc on Freenode.
